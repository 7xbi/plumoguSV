> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive SV plugin"

This is an SV plugin for [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver), the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive
rhythm game. The plugin contains various tools for editing SVs quickly and efficiently.
It's most similar to (i.e. 50% of SV features and some code stolen from) [iceSV](https://github.com/IceDynamix/iceSV).

Currently, the plugin supports the following SV tools:
* Linear
* Exponential
* Stutter
* Bezier
* Sinusoidal
* Single
* Remove

Details about these tools can be found at the [wiki page](https://github.com/kloi34/amoguSV/wiki)

## Installation
1. Press the green download code button on GitHub and click on "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to the "Plugins" folder (located inside the main Quaver folder)
