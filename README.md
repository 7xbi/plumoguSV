# amoguSV
This is a mapping plugin for the ultimate community-driven, and open-source competitive rhythm
game Quaver. The plugin contains various tools for editing SVs (Slider Velocities) quickly and
efficiently. It's most similar to (i.e. 50% of SV features and code stolen from) iceSV.

Currently, the plugin supports the following SV tools:
* Linear
* Exponential
* Stutter
* Bezier
* Sinusoidal
* Single
* Remove

More about these tools can be found at the [wiki page](https://github.com/kloi34/amoguSV/wiki)
## Installation
Press the green download code button on GitHub
