> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive SV plugin"

This is a plugin for [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver), the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive
rhythm game. The plugin contains various tools for editing SVs (Scroll Velocities) quickly and efficiently.
It's most similar to (i.e. 50% of SV features/ideas stolen from) [iceSV](https://github.com/IceDynamix/iceSV).

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP file by pressing the green download code button on GitHub and clicking "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to the "Plugins" folder (located inside the main Quaver folder)

## Overview
amoguSV can **quickly place sets of SVs between selected notes**. Such tools for placing SV sets include:
* Linear
* Exponential
* Stutter (also known as Bump)
* Bezier
* Sinusoidal
* Random

amoguSV also provides extra tools for placing specific SVs with:
* Single
* Still

Finally, if you want to edit SVs that are already placed, you can use these tools:
* Copy (& Paste)
* Remove

Each tool has many settings. I recommend you play around with the settings of these SV tools to learn how they work.
If something about the plugin is unclear you could probably ask around for help in the [Quaver Discord server](https://discord.gg/quaver).
