## Special Note
Most of the core ideas and base functionality were taken (stolen) from [iceSV](https://github.com/IceDynamix/iceSV) by [IceDynamix](https://github.com/IceDynamix). Other SV ideas also taken (stolen) from [Illuminati-CRAZ](https://github.com/Illuminati-CRAZ)’s SV plugins. Without  these two people’s contributions to SV plugins in general, amoguSV would not be as good as it is today or even exist in the first place, so huge thanks to them.
