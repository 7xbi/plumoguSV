> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive SV plugin"

This is an SV plugin for Quaver: the ultimate community-driven, and open-source competitive
rhythm game. The plugin contains various tools for editing SVs quickly and efficiently.
It's most similar to (i.e. 50% of SV features and code stolen from) iceSV.

Currently, the plugin supports the following SV tools:
* Linear
* Exponential
* Stutter
* Bezier
* Sinusoidal
* Single
* Remove

More about these tools can be found (later, when the wiki exists) at the [wiki page](https://github.com/kloi34/amoguSV/wiki)
## Installation
Press the green download code button on GitHub  
Download as a ZIP file  
Extract the ZIP file in the plugins folder (located in the main Quaver folder)
