> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive SV plugin"

This is an SV plugin for [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver), the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive
rhythm game. The plugin contains various tools for editing SVs quickly and efficiently.
It's most similar to (i.e. 50% of SV features and some code stolen from) [iceSV](https://github.com/IceDynamix/iceSV).

Currently, the plugin supports the following SV tools:
* Linear
* Exponential
* Stutter
* Bezier
* Sinusoidal
* Single
* Remove

More about these tools can be found (later, when the wiki exists) at the [wiki page](https://github.com/kloi34/amoguSV/wiki)
## Installation
1. Press the green download code button on GitHub and click on "Download ZIP"
2. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to the plugins folder (located inside the main Quaver folder)
