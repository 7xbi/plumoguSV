> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive SV plugin"

This is an SV plugin for [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver), the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive
rhythm game. The plugin contains various tools for editing SVs quickly and efficiently.
It's most similar to (i.e. 50% of SV features/ideas stolen from) iceSV.

Currently, the plugin supports the following SV tools:
* Linear
* Exponential
* Stutter
* Bezier
* Sinusoidal
* Single
* Remove

I recommend you to just play around with the settings of these SV tools to learn how they work.  
If something about the plugin is unclear you could probably ask around for help in the Quaver Discord server.

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP file by pressing the green download code button on GitHub and clicking "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to the "Plugins" folder (located inside the main Quaver folder)
